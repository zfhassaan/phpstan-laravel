# Collections

## pluck and keyBy

`pluck` and `keyBy` resolve their column against the collection's value type,
including nested paths and callbacks:

```php
$users->pluck('name', 'id');       // Collection<int, string>
$users->keyBy('name');             // EloquentCollection<string, App\User>
$posts->pluck('user.name');        // Collection<int, string>
$users->keyBy(fn ($u) => $u->id);  // EloquentCollection<int, App\User>
```

`pluck` rewrites both halves, so plucking a column off a collection of models
gives a support collection of whatever that column holds. `keyBy` rewrites only
the keys, so the value type and the collection class carry over.

### On a builder or a relation

`pluck` also resolves on an Eloquent builder, and on a relation, which forwards
it to the builder underneath:

```php
User::query()->pluck('name');            // Collection<int, string>
$user->accounts()->pluck('name');        // Collection<int, string>
$user->accounts()->pluck('name', 'id');  // Collection<int, string>
$post->user()->pluck('name');            // Collection<int, string>
```

The column is read from the *related* model, so `$post->user()->pluck('name')`
resolves `name` on `User` rather than on `Post`. Builder methods in the middle
of the chain do not break it, since they return the relation.

## only

`Arr::only` narrows an array shape to the keys you ask for. A key the array does
not have is dropped, since the call is a key intersection:

```php
/** @var array{id: int, name: string, email: string} $row */
Arr::only($row, ['id', 'name']);  // array{id: int, name: string}
Arr::only($row, 'id');            // array{id: int}
Arr::only($row, ['id', 'nope']);  // array{id: int}
```

Keys that are not known while analysing cannot be intersected. Since the call
can only ever drop entries, the result keeps the shape with every entry optional
rather than falling back to `array<string, mixed>`:

```php
Arr::only($row, $keys);  // array{id?: int, name?: string, email?: string}
```

Where there is no shape to intersect, the keys still narrow the key type:

```php
/** @var array<string, int> $map */
Arr::only($map, ['a', 'b']);  // array<'a'|'b', int>
```

!!! warning "No dot notation"

    `Arr::only` is an `array_intersect_key` over the top-level keys, so a dotted
    key matches a literal key that happens to contain a dot, and never a nested
    one. `Collection::only` behaves the same way:

    ```php
    Arr::only($nested, ['user.name']);  // array{}
    ```

    That is what the framework returns at runtime, so the inferred type is
    reporting the bug rather than causing it. Reach for `Arr::get` or `data_get`
    when you want a path, or `pluck`, which does resolve one.

`Model::only` builds a shape too, but out of a model's attributes, and answers
differently for a key that is not there. See
[reading a subset of attributes](model-properties.md#reading-a-subset-of-attributes).

## value

`value` reads a column off the first matching item, the same lookup `pluck`
uses, including nested paths:

```php
$users->value('name');        // string|null
$posts->value('user.name');   // string|null
$users->value('name', 'n/a'); // string
```

## countBy

`countBy` rewrites the keys the same way `groupBy` does, and the values are
the counts:

```php
$users->countBy('email');           // Collection<string, int>
$users->countBy(fn ($u) => $u->id); // Collection<int, int>
```

An Eloquent collection becomes a support collection, because the values are
no longer models.

## sum, min, max

A column or callback is resolved rather than left as `mixed`:

```php
$users->sum('id');    // int
$users->min('email'); // string|null
$users->max(fn ($u) => $u->id); // int|null
```

## collapse

`collapse` unwraps one level of collections or arrays. `collapseWithKeys`
keeps the inner keys instead of reindexing:

```php
/** @var Collection<int, Collection<string, User>> $nested */
$nested->collapse();            // Collection<int, User>
$nested->collapseWithKeys();    // Collection<string, User>
```

## mapToGroups

The callback returns one key/value pair per item. The key is the group, the
value goes into it. A literal stays a literal, because that callback can only
ever produce that group; a property or a branch is the union of what it can
actually return. Runtime only reads the first pair, so a second key in the
same array is ignored.

`mapToDictionary` is the same pair, but the values stay arrays. Eloquent
collections keep their class there (`new static()`), and `toBase()` the outer
collection for `mapToGroups` because those items are groups rather than
models:

```php
$users->mapToGroups(fn ($u) => [$u->email => $u]);
// Collection<string, EloquentCollection<int, User>>

$users->mapToGroups(fn ($u) => ['foo' => $u->id]);
// Collection<'foo', EloquentCollection<int, int>>

$users->mapToDictionary(fn ($u) => [$u->email => $u]);
// EloquentCollection<string, array<int, User>>
```

## transform

`transform` is `map` in place. `@phpstan-this-out` rewrites `$this` after the
call:

```php
$users->transform(fn (User $u) => $u->email);
// $users is Collection<int, string>
```

## toArray

`toArray` walks Arrayable items, including nested collections, instead of
widening to `mixed`:

```php
collect([1, 2, 3])->toArray();          // array<int, int>
$users->toArray();                      // array<int, array<string, mixed>>
$users->groupBy('email')->toArray();    // array<string, array<int, array<string, mixed>>>
```

## duplicates

`duplicates` maps through a column or callback the way `pluck` does, then
keeps the original keys of the values that appear more than once:

```php
$users->duplicates('email');       // Collection<int, string>
$users->duplicates(fn ($u) => $u->id); // Collection<int, int>
```

No argument leaves the value type alone. `duplicatesStrict` is the same map.

## flatten

A known depth unwraps that many levels. Omitted, it unwraps all the way:

```php
/** @var Collection<int, Collection<int, Collection<int, User>>> $deep */
$deep->flatten(1); // Collection<int, Collection<int, User>>
$deep->flatten();  // Collection<int, User>
```

## dot

Nested arrays become string keys and a union of the leaves:

```php
/** @var Collection<string, array{name: string, age: int}> $rows */
$rows->dot(); // Collection<string, int|string>
```

## Arr collapse, flatten, and dot

The array helpers unwrap the same way the collection methods do:

```php
/** @var list<list<User>> $nested */
Arr::collapse($nested);  // list<User>
Arr::flatten($nested);   // list<User>

/** @var array<string, array{name: string, age: int}> $rows */
Arr::dot($rows);         // array<string, int|string>
```

`Arr::random` and `Arr::sole` keep the array's value type. `Arr::mapSpread`
spreads each nested chunk into the callback, the same as `Collection::mapSpread`.

## groupBy

`groupBy` nests one level per grouper, and an array argument means successive
levels rather than a nested path:

```php
$users->groupBy('name');
// Collection<string, Collection<int, App\User>>

$users->groupBy(['name', 'id']);
// Collection<string, Collection<int, Collection<int, App\User>>>
```

`preserveKeys` decides the innermost keys:

```php
/** @var Collection<string, App\User> $keyed */
$keyed->groupBy('id');       // Collection<int, Collection<int, App\User>>
$keyed->groupBy('id', true); // Collection<int, Collection<string, App\User>>
```

## Precision, and widening it where you want it

Keys and values are resolved as precisely as the input allows. A grouper
returning a backed enum's value gives the literal union, and an interpolated key
gives the product of its parts:

```php
$items->groupBy(fn ($i) => $i->priority->value);          // Collection<10|20, ...>
$items->keyBy(fn ($i) => "{$i->a->value}|{$i->b->value}"); // Collection<'10|x'|'10|y'|..., ...>
```

That precision is not decoration. It survives to wherever you consume the
collection, so a refined key still reads as refined:

```php
foreach ($items->keyBy(fn ($i) => "row-{$i->id}") as $key => $item) {
    // $key is non-falsy-string, not string
}
```

`Collection` declares `TKey` and `TValue` invariantly, so an exact type is what
an annotation has to match. Where you would rather accept the general type, ask
for it at the annotation with `covariant`:

```php
/** @return Collection<covariant string, Item> */
public function keyed(): Collection
{
    return $this->items->keyBy(fn ($i) => "{$i->a->value}|{$i->b->value}");
}
```

That is use-site variance, and it applies to values the same way:

```php
/** @return Collection<int, covariant string> */
```

`array-key` also works for a key, being a benevolent union. A plain
`int|string` does not, despite reading like the safer choice: it is matched
invariantly and accepts neither `int` nor `string`.

## Higher order proxies

The proxy forms resolve the same way as the argument forms:

```php
$users->groupBy->email; // Collection<string, Collection<int, App\User>>
$users->keyBy->email;   // Collection<string, App\User>
```
