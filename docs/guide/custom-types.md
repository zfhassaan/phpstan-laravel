# Custom PHPDoc types

All custom types that are specific to this extension are listed here. Types that are defined by PHPStan
can be found on [their website](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types).


## view-string

The `view-string` type is a subset of the `string` type. Any `string` that passes the `view()->exists($string)` test
is also a valid `view-string`.

**Example:**

```php
/**
 * @phpstan-param view-string $view
 * @param string $view
 * @return \Illuminate\View\View
 */
public function renderView(string $view): View
{
    return view($view);
}
```
Now, whenever you call `renderView`, this extension will try to check whether 
the given string is a valid blade view.


If the string is not an existing blade view, the following error will be displayed by this extension.
```
Parameter #1 $view of method TestClass::renderView() expects view-string, string given.  
```

The `view`, `html`, `text`, and `markdown` constructor arguments of
`Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Content` are also `view-string|null`, including named
arguments. `htmlString` is rendered HTML and is not checked as a view name.

When working with packages, all vendor-prefixed paths like `acme::example` may fail. As packages don't contain a Laravel app, the default skeleton from `orchestra/testbench` is used. This instance doesn't know about the package so views are not registered. Create a `testbench.yaml` file to [register](https://packages.tools/testbench#package-service-providers) your service provider to solve this issue.

```yaml
providers:
    - Acme\AcmeServiceProvider
```

## model-property
`model-property` extends the built-in `string` type and acts like a string in the type level. But during the analysis if this extension finds that an argument of the method or a function has a `model-property<ModelName>`, it'll try to check that the given argument value is actually a property of the model.

All of the Laravel core methods have this type thanks to the stubs. So whenever you use a Eloquent builder, relation or a model method that expects a column, it'll be checked by this extension if the column actually exists. But you can also typehint any argument with `model-property` in your code.

The type is only active when [`modelPropertyType`](../reference/configuration.md#modelpropertytype) is enabled. With it off, `model-property<Model>` behaves as a plain `string` and nothing is checked. There is no rule behind it: once the type is active, the mismatches are reported by PHPStan's ordinary argument checks, so they carry core identifiers such as `argument.type`. See [checking column names](model-properties.md#checking-column-names) for a worked example.

## builder-of

The `builder-of<Model>` type resolves to the Eloquent builder for that model. A custom
builder from `newEloquentBuilder()` or `#[UseEloquentBuilder]` is used when the model
has one; otherwise it is `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder<Model>`.

A union of models becomes a union of their builders. Generic arguments, `static`,
`$this`, and intersections on the model are kept. Model query methods,
`Collection::toQuery()`, and relation query builders use it so custom builders
are retained.

```php
use App\User;
use App\Post;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

/**
 * @phpstan-return builder-of<User>
 */
function getActiveUsers(): Builder
{
    return User::query()->where('active', true);
}

/**
 * @phpstan-param builder-of<Post> $postQuery
 */
function publishPosts(Builder $postQuery): void
{
    $postQuery->where('foo', 'bar')->get()->each(fn ($post) => $post->publish());
}
```

It also works with generic templates:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

/**
 * @template TModel of \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
 */
class ModelRepository
{
    /**
     * @phpstan-param class-string<TModel> $modelClass
     * @phpstan-return builder-of<TModel>
     */
    public function getQuery(string $modelClass): Builder
    {
        return $modelClass::query();
    }
}
```

An optional second argument selects a relationship on the first model:

```php
/** @param builder-of<User, 'accounts'> $query */
function filterAccounts(Builder $query): void
{
    $query->where('active', true);
}
```

If `User::accounts()` relates to `Account`, this resolves to that model's
builder, including a custom builder. Dotted paths such as
`builder-of<User, 'posts.comments'>` resolve to the final related model.
Unions of models or relation names become unions of builders. Paths that
cannot resolve are discarded; if none resolve, the type falls back to
`builder-of<User>`.
