# Error identifiers

Every error this extension reports carries an identifier prefixed `laravel.`.
Identifiers are part of the [supported
surface](../about/backward-compatibility.md): they are what you ignore against,
so they are not renamed outside a major release. Message wording is not covered
and may be reworded at any time, which is why ignoring by identifier is always
preferable to ignoring by message.

```neon
parameters:
    ignoreErrors:
        - identifier: laravel.modelMake
```

An identifier names what was found, not the policy behind it, and never carries
a `no` prefix. Where one concern reports more than one kind of error, the
identifiers share a stem: `laravel.modelMethodVisibility.scope` and
`laravel.modelMethodVisibility.accessor`.

## Errors without a `laravel.` identifier

Some of what this extension does produces errors under PHPStan's own
identifiers, because the extension supplies better type information and
PHPStan's ordinary checks then do the reporting. These cannot be ignored
separately from the same check elsewhere in your code:

| What | Identifier |
| --- | --- |
| A column name that does not exist, via [`modelPropertyType`](configuration.md#modelpropertytype) | `argument.type` |
| A Blade view that does not exist, via `view-string` | `argument.type` |
| A property that is not a resolved column or accessor | `property.notFound` |
| Too few or too many arguments to a dispatched job or event | `arguments.count` |
| A dispatched argument of the wrong type | `argument.type` |

The last two are worth knowing about. [Dispatch argument
types](../rules/framework.md#dispatch-argument-types) delegates to PHPStan's own
argument checking, so only its no-constructor case gets a `laravel.` identifier.
The message still names the job and the constructor, so it is recognisable in
output, but you cannot ignore mismatched dispatch arguments by identifier
without also ignoring every other argument mismatch in your code.
